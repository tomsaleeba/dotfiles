The default Breeze cursor is terrible with Flameshot so you should change it.

The easiest way is:
1. go to the Breeze theme dir `cd /usr/share/icons/xcursor-breeze/cursors`
1. create a backup of the crosshair `sudo cp crosshair crosshair.bak`
1. copy the Adwaita crosshair into this theme `sudo cp ../../Adwaita/cursors/crosshair crosshair`
