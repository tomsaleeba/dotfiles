# config to use termite for ssh, which needs the quotes around the command
# thanks https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/183#issuecomment-129828996
# but nothing supports termite so we'll use another terminal
#rofi.ssh-command:          {terminal} -e "{ssh-client} {host}"

# run zsh in interactive mode so our ssh-agent hook function is used
rofi.ssh-command:          terminology -e 'zsh -i -c "ssh {host}; zsh"'
